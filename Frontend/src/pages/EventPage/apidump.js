What we'll be doing:
• Removing plastic debris, bottles, and other litter from the beach and nearby areas
• Sorting collected materials for proper recycling and disposal
• Recording data about the types and amounts of debris collected for environmental research
• Educating visitors about marine conservation

What's provided:
• All cleanup equipment(gloves, grabbers, trash bags)
• Safety briefing and orientation
• Refreshments and snacks during break time
• Educational materials about marine conservation
• Certificate of participation for volunteer hours

Impact: Last year, our beach cleanup events removed over 2, 500 pounds of debris from local beaches and engaged more than 500 volunteers in hands - on environmental action.`,
